# Hand Gesture Mouse Pointer Control

A Python project that uses computer vision and hand tracking to control your computer's mouse pointer using intuitive hand gestures. This project leverages [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/), and [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/) to provide a contactless way to interact with your computer.

## Features

- **Pointer Movement:**  
  Move the mouse pointer by simply moving your index finger.

- **Left Click / Drag:**  
  Perform left-clicks by extending your thumb. Hold the gesture for a short period to initiate dragging.

- **Right Click / Drag:**  
  Trigger right-clicks by raising your middle finger. Similarly, holding the gesture will start a drag.

- **Scrolling:**  
  Activate scroll mode by performing a pinch gesture (bringing the index finger and thumb close together) and move your finger vertically to scroll.
